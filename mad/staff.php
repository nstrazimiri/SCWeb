                and becoming a strong software developer, you have selected the right program. The faculty who teach in
                this program are also passionate about what they do and work closely with industry to ensure this
                program is up-to-date using the latest technologies in the field. The five specific areas of learning
                are Mobile Development (Android and iOS), Web Development, Desktop Development, and Game Development.
